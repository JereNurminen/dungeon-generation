# Dungeon generator

A very simple dungeon generation script from a roguelike I'm working on.
The code is pretty messy, inefficient and honestly not that interesting - I wrote this over a few nightly coding sessions and 
I haven't really returned to this since then.
I need to revisit this at some point to both expand it and rewrite the whole thing (mostly because I have no idea what's going on here anymore), I'll possibly update this repo as I update the one in game.

## What's missing?

There's no branches in the dungeon, so it's just one series of rooms one after another. I'm planning on adding both branching rooms, and other kinds of structures like tunnels.

Another missing thing is any items, enemies or other points of interest besides entrance, exit and doors.
